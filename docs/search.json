    "text": "Overview\nThis study investigates whether a cyclic adjustment training (CAT) intervention delivered via a smartphone can improve psychological resilience and reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in post-surgical women with breast cancer. High resilience in breast cancer survivors improves family functioning, psychological well-being, and the overall quality of life.This study is especially relevant for China, were long-term hospital-based psychological rehabilitation is uncommon and patients tend to leave the hospital comparably early.\nThis study is one of three out of 22 studies in the meta-analysis that yielded acceptable levels of risk of bias. Furthermore it produced the second biggest effect size of all 22 studies with an effect size of 1.97 [1.56, 2.38] (Hedges g).\n\n\nWhat is this study about?\nThe authors used WeChat to deliver the cyclic adjustment training (CAT). WeChat-based interventions are fairly common in China. During CAT patient is confronted with the negative stimulus who is then trained to cope with the stimulus. This results in a pre-introspective stage in which the patient adjusts to his/her condition. Then there is another re-introspective stage in which the patient can adapt through feedback. Another cycle begins if a new negative stimulus is introduced or the negative stimulus was not well treated.\nThis study consisted of 66 women in a control group who only received routine nursing care for 12 weeks and an intervention group of 66 women who received CAT in addition to the routine nursing care. The data collectors and patients were blinded to group allocation.\n\n\nWhat does this study find?\nPatients in the intervention group showed significantly improved resilience, anxiety and depression scores. This was also evident on all of the three follow-up measures. As described above, the effect sizes were large. In summary it can be said that CAT has beneficial effects on psychological resilience and symptoms of anxiety and depression in the early stages of the long-term rehabilitation of post-surgical women with breast cancer.\n\n\nHow does the Digital Psychology Lab teaching evaluate this study?\nThe large effect sizes and the low risk of bias make these findings appear quite trustworthy.However there could be a point of contention relating to the difference between the intervention and the control group. The intervention group received more attention and devotion on part of the hospital staff than the control group, since they had additional CAT sessions. This suggests that the large effect sizes may not solely stem from the efficacy of the intervention, but other factors may have contributed to these effects.\n\n\nConclusion\nThere are two main conclusions to be drawn from this study:\n\nMobile phone applications can be useful tools in promoting psychological resilience\nCAT is an effective psychological intervention strategy for women with breast cancer at an early stage of long-term rehabilitation\n\n\n\nReferences\nZhou, K., Li, J., & Li, X.

    "text": "What is this study about?\nDepression is a big issue in many peoples life and the availability of mental health care is still insufficient. For this reason digitally delivered mental health care could help providing psychological support on a greater scale. One way to deliver mental health care is via a smartphone app. One such app would be the Meru Health Program (MHP), which consists of elements from three evidence-based interventions for depression. This elements are behavioral activation, mindfulness, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The app includes support by a licensed remote therapist; text, videos, audio-guided mindfulness meditation exercises, infographics illustrating CBT principles, and journal prompts.\nThis study examined the effect of an 8-week intervention study, where they compared the effect of MHP on major depression compared to a control group. Therefore, young finish adults with a diagnosis of major depression either continued their treatment as usual (control group) or did additionally the MHP intervention. Depressive symptops, anxiety symptoms, sleep problems, perceived stress, quality of life, resilience, mindfulness and attrition were assessed at the beginning of the intervention, the middle of the intervention (after 4 weeks), the end of the intervention (after 8 weeks), 3 months after the intervention and 6 months after the intervention.\n\n\nWhat does this study find?\nThe control group and the MHP intervention group did not differ in their depression symptoms throughout the end of the intervention and follow-ups.\nPatients on antidepressants showed significantly greater reduction in depression after 6 months the MHP intervention group versus the control group. Patients not on antidepressants showed no between-group differences.\nBut an increase in resilience and mindfulness and a reduction in perceived stress has been found in the MHP intervention group compared to the control group. There were no differences found in anxiety, sleep disturbances, and quality of life between the groups.\n\n\nReferences\nRaevuori, A., Vahlberg, T., Korhonen, T., Hilgert, O., Aittakumpu-Hyden, R., & Forman-Hoffman, V.

    "text": "Resilience as it is imagined by DALL-E2\n\n\nCoping with stress: In times of crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts, mental health issues have climbed to an all time high. Stress is a primary driver of those, which is why building a psychological “defense shield” against stress and its consequences is crucial. Resilience is the scientific term for this defense shield and describes the ability to successfully overcome adversity. Since former studies have shown that resilience can be trained in physical face-to-face settings, this meta-analysis investigates whether digitally delivered resilience training can also be efficacious.\n\nOverview\n\nFocus of the study\nInvestigating the efficacy of digital resilience training.\n\n\nTarget group\nThe general public, healthcare professionals (both concerning their patients’ and their own resilience) and game developers.\n\n\nEffect size\nModerate to strong effects in favor of digital resilience training.\n\n\nFurther notable results\nInternet-based interventions with a flexible training schedule showed the most promising effects compared to other intervention types\n\n\n\nWhat is this study about?\nStress is a primary driver of mental health issues such as depression or anxiety. Especially tough times like the COVID-19 pandemic tend to leave their marks on our collective mental well-being. Building resilience or, in other words, psychological resistance against stress is crucial for preventing the development of mental health problems. This not only affects the general public, but also healthcare professionals, with 26% reporting low resilience. People with a higher degree of resilience enjoy be tter well-being and health, tend to be more productive and report more academic success. Given the importance of resilience, understanding the different conceptualizations is essential. Resilience can be perceived from a trait, process or outcome perspective. The trait perspective describes it as a component of one’s personality, something stable over time, while the process perspective views it as something volatile and dynamic, and focusses on how resilient one feels at the moment. The outcome perspective merely is interested in whether one is able to bounce back from adversity or mental health issues and not so much in how one perceives it subjectively. Irrespective of conceptual variance, research found that people are able to train their resilience. The question that remains to be answered is “How do you train it?”.\nAccording to resilience theory, resilience is characterized by a multitude of components and mechanisms, ranging from the cellular to the societal level. The majority of existing resilience interventions, however, have been focussing on the psychosocial domain, targeting personal and relational factors. Fostering cognitive flexibility, for instance, marks one personal approach. Cognitive flexibility refers to the ability to reframe a stressful situation and thereby finding alternative solutions to it. In terms of relational interventions, strengthening one’s social support and relationships was shown to increase resilience. Since more conclusive evidence was found with respect to these psychosocial factors, the current meta-analysis focuses on them. Due to the advancements in telecommunication technologies and a general rise in digital literacy, the provision of resilience interventions via digital media has increased. This potentially offers comprehensive accessibility of such interventions and is therefore important to be investigated.\nThe current meta-analysis assesses the efficacy of resilience trainings delivered via computers, mobile devices or the internet. While face-to-face interventions with physical presence have been shown to improve one’s resilience both as a therapeutic measure and a preventive tool for the general population, it remains unclear whether this is also true in a digital context. While both modalities (face-to-face and digital) offer the possibility of synchronous communication, it has been shown that the lack of physical presence can attenuate a learner’s interest and motivation in an online paradigm. In light of the improvements in the digital infrastructure, the affinity of the general public towards digital technologies and a continuous increase in mental health issues, it is crucial to evaluate the potential of digital interventions to foster resilience. Therefore, this meta-analysis intends to (1) assess the effectiveness of digital resilience training and (2) extract the most important features for designing such interventions.\n\n\nWhat does this study find?\nThis Meta-Analysis found an overall moderate increase in resilience directly after the intervention and an overall large effect on resilience up to 6 months after the resilience training. The effect directly after the intervention was greater when the intervention did not include cognitive flexibility skills ,when the intervention was done over the internet and when participants could do the training at their own pace.\nRegarding anxiety, depressive symptoms and stress this meta-analysis reported that resilience training has no effect on anxiety and stress symptoms directly after the intervention and only a small effect on anxiety after 6 months. The resilience training could reduce depressive symptoms directly after the intervention and after 6 months with a small effect.\n\n\nQualitiy of the meta-analysis\nThe meta-analysis itself does a good job of inspecting the quality of the evidence. The review was prepared in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and prospectively registered in the PROSPERO database. It uses several measures to evaluate the overall quality of the evidence. However there is an exaggeration in the abstract of the meta-analysis, succumbing to the bad practice of hyping one’S results.\n\n\nQuality of the evidence\nThe evidence is not credible. The funnel plot and the Egger regression test indicate a publication bias. The risk of bias was not satisfactory for 19 out of the 22 included studies. Using the GRADE criteria the quality of the evidence ranges from very low to low.Heterogeneous findings and variation in the population and intervention characteristics further complicate the picture. Altogether more high-quality studies need to be conducted before conclusive assertions can be made.The meta-analysis suggest that reported effect sizes may be inflated to a large extent.\n\n\nConclusion for teaching practice\nThere are no substantial conclusions that can be drawn from this meta-analysis due to the dubious nature of the credibility of the findings. Expressed in the words of the authors, this means that: “more attention is warranted to improve the quality of future trials to ensure that grounded inferences may be made from its conclusions.”.\n\n\nStudy example\nA therapist-guided smartphone app for major depression in young adults\nThe comparative effect of internet-based cognitive behavioral counseling versus face to face cognitive behavioral counseling in terms of student’s resilience\nEffects of cyclic adjustment training delivered via a mobile device on psychological resilience, depression, and anxiety in Chinese post-surgical breast cancer patients\n\n\nReferences\nAng, W.

    "text": "What is this study about?\nStress is leading factor regarding the development of mental health issues, such as anxiety disorders and depression. Improving one’s ability to overcome or bounce back from adversities therefore represents an a crucial way of maintaining or recovering to mental health. This ability is termed resilience.\nThe current study investigates whether resilience training shows short-term as well as long-term improvements. Secondly, the authors compare internet-based and face-to-face resilience-training in terms of efficacy. Additionally, both are compared to a control group consisting of individuals waiting for treatment. 90 pupils with a mean age of 12 participated in the study, i.e., 30 in each group.\n\n\nWhat does this study find?\nThe internet-based and the face to face resilience training showed no significant difference. Both, however, elicited a self-reported increase in resilience. Further, both training variants differed significantly from the control group after the training, but were equal before. We can therefore conclude that training was successful in both training groups. Even five weeks after the end of the training phase, differences between both training groups and the control group were still significant.\nHowever, we should be careful with interpreting these findings, as the study not only illustrates a comparatively huge effect size, but also has some weaknesses. In general, many important things were not reported, such as the individual resilience values, whether the participants were aware of the other groups etc. These things can have implications on the analyses, which is why caution is advised when it comes to interpret these findings.\n\n\nReferences\nKadek Suranata, Itsar Bolo Rangka & Agus Aan Jiwa Permana | (2020) The comparative effect of internet-based cognitive behavioral counseling versus face to face cognitive behavioral counseling in terms of student’s resilience, Cogent Psychology, 7:1, 1751022, DOI: 10.1080/23311908.2020.175102\nDownload article"
