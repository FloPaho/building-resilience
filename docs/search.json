Stress is a primary driver of those, which is why building a psychological “defense shield” against stress and its consequences is crucial. Resilience is the scientific term for this defense shield and describes the ability to successfully overcome adversity. Since former studies have shown that resilience can be trained in physical face-to-face settings, this meta-analysis investigates whether digitally delivered resilience training can also be efficacious."
